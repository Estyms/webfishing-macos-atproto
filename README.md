# AtProto Webfishing for MacOS

So I've made a webfishing mod to remote save to your own bluesky account using the AtProtocol.

However it was made to work only with GdWeave.

So now I've made a version that works with my own [webfishing macos installer](https://github.com/Estyms/webfishing-macos-installer)


# Installation

- Build the game once with the [webfishing macos installer](https://github.com/Estyms/webfishing-macos-installer) 
- Put the two mod folders [tacklebox-resources, webfishing-atproto] in the ´mods´ folder
- Rebuild the game with the [webfishing macos installer](https://github.com/Estyms/webfishing-macos-installer)
